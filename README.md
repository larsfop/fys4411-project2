Project 2 for Computational physics 2 - FYS4411

A continuation of project 1. This project uses VMC with Slater determinants to simulate and compute the expectation value for the lowest state energy for a N electron system. We will use 2, 6 and 12 electons in two different classes. The first class SimpleGaussian
